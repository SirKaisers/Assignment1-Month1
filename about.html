    <h3>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program:</h3>

    <p id="bottom">My overarching goal in the School of Engineering program is to emerge as a highly skilled Cloud Engineer, 
        equipped with the expertise to design, deploy, and optimize cloud-based solutions that meet modern demands. 
         I aim to gain proficiency in leading cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, 
          while also mastering essential concepts like infrastructure-as-code, containerization, DevOps workflows, and cloud security best practices. 
           Throughout the program, I plan to work on diverse projects—ranging from setting up virtual servers to automating deployments—that will 
            solidify my technical skills and demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems. I also want to develop a strong professional network
              by collaborating with peers and mentors, which I believe will be invaluable as I grow in this field. By the end of the program,
                 I hope to have a robust portfolio that not only showcases my technical capabilities but also reflects my creativity and dedication.
                   Long-term, my ambition is to use these skills to drive technological advancement in my community, empower businesses with efficient cloud solutions, 
                    and inspire others to explore the transformative power of engineering and technology.
